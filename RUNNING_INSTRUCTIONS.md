# How to Run **Campus Sentinel** locally

This repository is a **Next.js 16** application that uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Follow the steps below to get the development server up and running.

---

## 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20 or later) – you can download it from https://nodejs.org.
- **pnpm** – the preferred package manager for this project.
  ```bash
  npm i -g pnpm
  ```
  (If you prefer `npm`, you can still use it, but the lockfile is generated by pnpm, so `pnpm install` is recommended.)
- (Optional) **Git** – to clone the repo if you haven't already.

---

## 2️⃣ Install dependencies

Open a terminal in the project root (`campus_sentinel`) and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will read `pnpm-lock.yaml` and install **all** required packages, including `next`, `react`, `radix-ui`, etc.

> **Why pnpm?**
> pnpm creates a content‑addressable store and links packages, which makes installation faster and uses less disk space. The lockfile is already in pnpm format, so `pnpm install` guarantees the exact same versions the project was built with.

---

## 3️⃣ Set up environment variables (if needed)

The project may rely on a `.env.local` file for API keys or database URLs. If you see errors about missing env vars after the next step, create a file called `.env.local` in the root and add the required variables, e.g.:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

(Ask the repository owner for the exact keys if you’re not sure.)

---

## 4️⃣ Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev   # or: npm run dev
```

The command runs `next dev` (see `package.json`). After a few seconds you should see:

```
> Ready on http://localhost:3000
```

Open that URL in your browser. Hot‑module replacement (HMR) is enabled, so any code change will automatically refresh the page.

## 5️⃣ Common pitfalls & fixes

| Problem                                          | Fix                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev` says **"next: command not found"** | Make sure you ran `pnpm install` (or `npm install`) first. The `next` binary lives in `node_modules/.bin`.                                                |
| **Port 3000 already in use**                     | Either stop the other process or run the dev server on a different port: `pnpm dev -- -p 3001`                                                            |
| **TypeScript build errors**                      | The project deliberately sets `ignoreBuildErrors: true` in `next.config.mjs`. You can still run the dev server; the errors are only shown in the console. |
| **Missing `node_modules` folder**                | Delete `pnpm-lock.yaml` and run `pnpm install` again, or run `pnpm install --force` to rebuild the store.                                                 |

---

## 6️⃣ Production build (optional)

When you’re ready to test a production bundle:

```bash
pnpm build   # creates .next folder
pnpm start   # runs the compiled app on http://localhost:3000
```
